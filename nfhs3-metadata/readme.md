## NFHS-3 metadata

The NFHS-3 was conducted in 2005-2006 and the [full dataset](http://www.dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-264.cfm) is available.  The survey organization DHS has put out a detailed Final Report, and a summary of that report, which present descriptive statistics.  But no one has built predictive models or generally applied machine learning to the data.

The data can't be posted publicly (stay tuned for a private link for sharing!; but anyone can register at the site and download it directly), but here are some metadata files that describe the variables we have available to work with.



## Files

* 'IAHR52FL.txt': Codebook for the roughly 200 useful variables in the **household** dataset.  The full dataset is 109041 x 3588, and comes in at about 440 MB.  There are so many variables because the questionnaire allows for up to 35 people living in the same household!

* 'NFHS3SUP.PDF': Possibly useful supplemental documentation provided by DHS, including "notable variables".

* 'FRIND3-Vol1AndVol2.pdf': Final Report on the NFHS-3, put out by DHS, from [here](http://www.dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-264.cfm).

* 'SR128_updated_09-22-2015.pdf': Summary Report on the NFHS-3, put out by DHS, from [here](http://www.dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-264.cfm).
