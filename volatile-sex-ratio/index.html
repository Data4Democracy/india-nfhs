            India's <i>volatile</i> sex ratio

        <sub>Punjab shows us how to reign in this wild horse with the oldest 
        trick in the book - consistency.</sub>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Gaurav, aged 34 hails from the city of Rohtak, Haryana where he works as a
            domestic help and lives with his wife and 2 children. His wife is from Tamil
            Nadu and at first glance the couple might seem like an example of progressive, 
            interstate marriage in a state rife with rigid marriage laws but nothing could 
            be further from the truth.

            He is one of the many <i>Haryanvi</i> men who were forced to find brides from other states,
            as years of rampant female foeticide and rigid societal structures resulted in 
            a drastically low sex ratio. 
            Haryana is not the only state with a skewed ratio, but as per the National 
            Family Health Scheme 2015-16, Haryana has the lowest sex ratio
            at 876 females per thousand males. The map below shows the sex-ratio distribution
            across the country:

            <p>
            The inspiriting observation that most states have a sex-ratio higher than 970 
            is watered down by the fact the sex-ratio is a highly volatile metric. 
            When compared to the NFHS survey of 2005, almost 50% of the states have seen 
            a fall, some even to the tune of 6%.

        <div class="story">
            <p>
            What adds to the administrative anxiety is the fact that even the states that
            are doing very positive can see a drastic fall. Take the case of Karnataka
            for instance - in the 2005-06 NFHS survey, it comfortably had 1028 women
            per thousand men; but in 2015-16, the same fell by 49, to 979.

            It is these major shifts that India needs to learn to be wary about and work
            against. These variations become highlighted when the sex ratio observed 
            during the Census survey are observed in contrast with that of the 
            National Family Health Scheme.

            During the Census survey 2011, the majority of states showed a marginal 
            positive increase in sex ratio, in comparison to the Census survey 2005. But when 
            we switch to NFHS - 2015, the majority failed to register any improvement
            in the sex ratio. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In this commotion of fluctuating <i>"life"</i>-ratios, Punjab gives us hope.
            It is the only state which showed positive growth in both Census survey of 2011
            and NFHS 2015. If India is to achieve this delicate balance, each of the other states
            will need to learn from Punjab.
